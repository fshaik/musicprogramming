Assignment 4 - Faisal

This piece is a sonification of my year with the activity monitor Jawbone UP. 
I used sleep and activity time in minutes and then normalized the data such that all values were between 0 and 1.
These values were then mapped directly to the pitch of the note played. Sleep and activity were played on two different instruments
  
Some interesting trends include sleep echoing activity. I seem to sleep more when I am more active. 
Periods of motivation and lazyness can also be heard through the piece.
